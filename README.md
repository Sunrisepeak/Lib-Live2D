# HuxerUI Live2D

Display and animate Live2D characters in a HuxerUI application. Load a Cubism `.model3.json` package, place a `ModelView` in your layout, and control motions and expressions through a `ModelController`.

The library supports independent character instances, motion playback, expressions, automatic blinking and breathing, physics and pose updates, parameter overrides, hit areas, and pause/resume. It integrates with normal HuxerUI sizing, clipping, transforms, and opacity.

This is an early implementation. The preview includes three official sample characters: Mao, Haru, and Hiyori.

## Platform support

| Platform | Backend | Validation status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS arm64 | Metal | Built; integration tests and three-character display/input checks passed |
| Android arm64 | OpenGL ES / EGL | Built; Wanko and Mao displayed on a physical device; latest loading/UI changes still need device regression checks |
| Web | Cubism Web / WebGL / VideoFrame | Built; three-character display, switching, expressions, and responsive layout checked in a browser |
| iOS arm64 Simulator | Metal | Built and launched; Mao orientation checked in a simulator screenshot; switching/input checks pending |
| Windows | D3D11 | Implemented; build and runtime checks pending |
| Linux x86_64 | OpenGL / GDK | Implemented; build and runtime checks pending |

Two build chains cover the same six platforms: CMake through the HuxerUI CLI, and [mcpp](https://github.com/mcpp-community/mcpp) from one manifest (its CI builds, smoke-runs and packs the preview on every row). See [validation records](tests/README.md) for exact coverage. Older Apple OS compatibility is not established for the pinned Core binaries; see [SDK compatibility](docs/cubism-sdk.md#toolchains-and-compatibility).

## Requirements

A model package you have permission to use, including its `.model3.json` and every referenced dependency. The rest depends on the build chain.

### With headers and CMake

- HuxerUI SDK and CLI, tested with version 0.3.0.
- A C++20 toolchain, CMake, and the platform tools required by HuxerUI.
- Python 3 for downloading the pinned Cubism SDKs.
- Cubism Native and/or Web 5 R5 (`5-r.5`).

Android builds use JDK 17. Apple builds require Xcode with the Metal compiler. Linux integration requires GTK 4.6+ and GLEW. Web builds also require Node.js, npm, Emscripten, and browser support for `VideoFrame`.

### With C++20/23 modules and mcpp

mcpp (`xlings install mcpp -y --use`). The Cubism SDKs, GLEW, esbuild, the NDK, emsdk and the JDK are payloads mcpp installs on first use; iOS additionally needs Xcode on a Mac.

## Try the preview

The preview includes Mao, Haru, and Hiyori under `examples/preview/resources/raw/`. Use the bottom toolbar to switch characters, pause playback, or trigger an interaction; the adjustment panel exposes the selected model's motions and expressions.

### With headers and CMake

From this repository's root, download the dependencies:

```sh
python3 tools/fetch_cubism.py
```

The script verifies pinned archive hashes and extracts both SDKs into `.cache/cubism`; builds package the models under `examples/preview/resources/raw/` directly and do not copy them from the SDK cache.

Build or run the preview with HuxerUI:

```sh
huxerui run macos
huxerui build android --java-home /path/to/jdk17
huxerui devices ios
huxerui build ios --device <simulator-id>
```

For Web, install the additional build dependencies in this repository first:

```sh
npm install --prefix .cache/web-tools --no-audit --no-fund esbuild@0.25.12 typescript@5.9.3
huxerui run web
```

Controls adapt to narrow and wide windows.

The preview follows the system language, with English as the fallback and Simplified Chinese and Japanese translations. Interface text lives in `examples/preview/resources/strings/default.properties`, `zh.properties`, and `ja.properties`, accessed through the generated `app::strings` identifiers. Add a locale catalog with the same keys to provide another translation. Language changes preserve the loaded character and playback state. The window title stays `Live2D`; model identifiers and SDK diagnostic details retain their original text.

### With C++20/23 modules and mcpp

From `examples/preview/`:

```sh
mcpp run                                          # this machine
mcpp pack --format appimage                       # Linux; --format msi on Windows, --format app on macOS
mcpp pack --target wasm32-emscripten --format web # a static directory
mcpp run  --target x86_64-linux-android --format apk   # an emulator or a device, through adb-run
mcpp run  --target aarch64-ios-sim --format app        # a booted simulator, through simctl-run
```

Two things stay with the CMake build for now: the preview's own string catalogue (`resources/strings`), and runnable macOS/iOS bundles (mcpp 2026.9.13.1 does not stage Mach-O programs, so `--format app` carries the executable only). [`mcpp/README.md`](mcpp/README.md) says how the package is put together.

## Add the library to your application

### With headers and CMake

In your application's CMake file, after creating `my_app`:

```cmake
huxerui_use_library(my_app
    TARGET HuxerUI::Live2D
    URL "https://github.com/HuxerUI/Lib-Live2D.git"
    TAG "v0.1.0"
)

if (NOT HUXERUI_LIBRARY_GRAPH_ONLY AND (APPLE OR EMSCRIPTEN))
    live2d_configure_app(my_app)
endif ()
```

Include `<huxerui/live2d.h>` and use the `huxerui::live2d` namespace. No `Install()` call is required.

The URL dependency fetches the wrapper, not the Cubism SDKs. Before configuring the application, set `LIVE2D_CUBISM_NATIVE_ROOT` for Native builds or `LIVE2D_CUBISM_WEB_ROOT` for Web builds to an extracted Cubism 5 R5 SDK. These are CMake cache variables; without overrides, they point into the fetched library's `.cache/cubism`. Web builds also require the npm build dependencies described above in the fetched library directory.

Shader deployment depends on the platform:

| Platform | Application setup |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | `live2d_configure_app` adds `FrameworkMetallibs` to the application bundle |
| iOS | The helper stages `live2d-ios/FrameworkMetallibs` under the CMake build directory; copy this directory to the final Xcode application bundle's root in a resource build phase |
| Web | The helper places `live2d-shaders` beside the generated application JavaScript; deploy that directory with the application |
| Android / Linux / Windows | No additional application shader-copy step is required by this library |

The [preview CMake configuration](examples/preview/CMakeLists.txt) and [iOS project](examples/preview/platform/ios) show the complete packaging setup.

### With C++20/23 modules and mcpp

One line in `mcpp.toml` and one import:

```toml
[dependencies]
huxerui.live2d = { git = "https://github.com/HuxerUI/Lib-Live2D.git", tag = "<a release that carries mcpp.toml>" }
# exactly one of tag / rev / branch: tag for a release, rev for one commit, branch to follow it
```

```cpp
import huxerui;
import huxerui.live2d;
```

No `live2d_configure_app()`, no SDK path, no `npm install`: the Cubism SDKs are payloads, and the shaders (the Metal libraries, the WebGL shaders, the embedded GLSL/HLSL) are deployed by the library into every `mcpp pack --format`.

## Load and display a model

For a model already available in the application's local file system, pass its manifest as a `File` from a loading task:

```cpp
auto result = co_await LoadModelAsync(File("/path/to/Character/Character.model3.json"));
```

The loader uses the manifest's parent directory as the package root and opens declared dependencies automatically. Dependencies must stay lexically within that root; symbolic links follow normal `File` behavior. On Web, `File` refers to the virtual file system. File I/O failures retain their original error in `LoadError::cause`.

For HuxerUI's bundled resources, pass a generated `RawResource` plus a callback that opens the manifest and its dependencies. The current resource API does not provide relative lookup from a single raw asset, so this entry point requires a resource mapping:

Keep the model's original directory structure under your application's raw resources. For example, a minimal package could contain:

```text
resources/raw/Character/
    Character.model3.json
    Character.moc3
    textures/texture_00.png
```

Use the actual names from your model's manifest. Also package and map every referenced motion, expression, physics, pose, display-info, and user-data file. Model textures must remain raw files; the Native backend decodes PNG textures.

The following component assumes your generated application's resource namespace is `app` and the package uses the three paths above. The typed `app::raw` identifiers for the files come from HuxerUI's resource compiler and are passed directly to `UseRawResource`; the map keys remain the package-relative paths requested by Live2D and are distinct from the generated C++ identifiers. Extend `resources` with the actual identifiers, and call `CharacterView()` from your application's view tree.

Add the component to a source file of your application target and include HuxerUI's generated `app_resources.h`:

```cpp
#include <huxerui/huxerui.h>
#include <huxerui/live2d.h>
#include "app_resources.h"
#include <map>
#include <stdexcept>

using namespace huxerui;
using namespace huxerui::live2d;

using ModelResources = std::map<std::string, RawAsset>;

Task<IoResult<AsyncInputStream>> OpenModelResource(ModelResources resources, std::string path) {
  const auto found = resources.find(path);
  if (found == resources.end()) {
    co_return IoResult<AsyncInputStream>::Failure({IoErrorCode::NotFound, path});
  }
  try {
    co_return IoResult<AsyncInputStream>::Success(co_await found->second.OpenReadAsync());
  } catch (const std::runtime_error& error) {
    co_return IoResult<AsyncInputStream>::Failure({IoErrorCode::Io, error.what()});
  }
}

Task<void> LoadCharacter(ModelResources resources, State<ModelAsset> asset, State<std::string> status) {
  auto result = co_await LoadModelAsync(app::raw::Character_Character_model3_json, [resources](std::string path) {
    return OpenModelResource(resources, std::move(path));
  });
  if (!result.Succeeded()) {
    status = result.Error().path + ": " + result.Error().message;
    co_return;
  }
  asset = std::move(result).Value();
  status = "Preparing graphics...";
}

[[huxerui::composable]]
View CharacterView() {
  auto asset = UseState(ModelAsset{});
  auto status = UseState(std::string("Loading model..."));
  auto paused = UseState(false);
  const ModelController controller = UseState(ModelController{});
  auto tasks = UseTaskScope();

  ModelResources resources{
    {"Character/Character.model3.json", UseRawResource(app::raw::Character_Character_model3_json)},
    {"Character/Character.moc3", UseRawResource(app::raw::Character_Character_moc3)},
    {"Character/textures/texture_00.png", UseRawResource(app::raw::Character_textures_texture_00_png)},
  };
  Lifecycle([tasks, resources, asset, status] {
    auto request = tasks.Launch(LoadCharacter(resources, asset, status));
    return [request] { request.Cancel(); };
  });

  if (!asset->HasValue()) return Text(status);
  const ModelAsset loaded = asset;
  return Column {
    ModelView(loaded, {.controller = controller, .paused = paused})
        .On<ModelEvents::Ready>([controller, loaded, status] {
          status = "Ready";
          for (const auto& group : loaded.Info().motion_groups) {
            if (group.count == 0) continue;
            auto result = controller.PlayMotion(group.name, 0, {.loop = true});
            if (!result.Succeeded()) status = result.Error().message;
            break;
          }
        })
        .On<ModelEvents::HitAreaTapped>([status](std::string name) { status = "Tapped: " + name; })
        .On<ModelEvents::PlaybackFailed>([status](PlaybackError error) { status = error.message; })
        .With(Frame{.width = 360.0F, .height = 480.0F}),
    Text(status),
    Button(paused ? "Resume" : "Pause").OnClick([paused] { paused = !paused; }),
  }.With(Spacing(8.0F));
}
```

The example loops the first available motion; select an idle group explicitly if your model provides one. Loading succeeds before GPU preparation finishes: wait for `ModelEvents::Ready` before sending playback commands.

The `RawResource` overload accepts an `OpenResourceAsync` callback. It receives normalized paths relative to the entry domain's raw root, without the `raw/` prefix, and must return a fresh stream for each request. For the example above, the first request is `Character/Character.model3.json`; texture requests include `Character/textures/texture_00.png`. The callback is responsible for accessing the same resource domain as the entry. Convert recoverable storage-opening exceptions to `IoResult` in that adapter. Use `TaskScope` to own loading work; do not read whole model files during composition.

For model switching, retry handling, and a complete application, see the [preview source](examples/preview/src/app.cpp). It references `app::raw` identifiers from HuxerUI's automatically generated `app_resources.h`; no separate model resource header is required.

### With C++20/23 modules and mcpp

The same component is a module unit with no `#include`: the identifiers arrive through `import app.resources;`, the module hrc writes from the same list as the header, and the body is unchanged.

```cpp
export module app;

import std;
import huxerui;
import huxerui.live2d;
import app.resources;
```

`huxerui create app <name> --build mcpp --template live2d` renders a complete application in this form.

## Control playback

Retain a controller across recompositions and attach it to one `ModelView`. Reuse a loaded `ModelAsset` with separate controllers to display independent instances. Omitting the controller gives the view a stable internal controller.

Call commands on the mounted UI thread, usually from an event handler:

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `PlayMotion(group, index, options)` | `Result<PlaybackId, PlaybackError>`; success means playback was accepted |
| `StopMotion()` | `PlaybackError`; `code == PlaybackErrorCode::None` means success |
| `SetExpression(name)` | `PlaybackError` |
| `ClearExpression()` | `PlaybackError` |

Read `asset.Info().motion_groups`, `expressions`, `parameters`, and `hit_areas` to discover names and ranges. Motion indices start at zero. Names such as `Idle` and `TapBody` belong to particular models and are not universal.

`MotionOptions` defaults to priority `1`, `force = false`, and `loop = false`. Priority must be positive. A lower-priority request may return `PriorityRejected`; use `force = true` when your interaction should replace the current motion. Retain the returned `PlaybackId` when correlating completion events.

Persistent settings belong in `ModelOptions`:

| Option | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fit` | `ImageFit::Contain` | Fit the model into the view's bounds |
| `paused` | `false` | Freeze model time |
| `playback_rate` | `1.0F` | Finite value from `0` through `8`; zero freezes time |
| `auto_blink` / `auto_breath` | `true` | Enable model-supported automatic effects |
| `parameters` | Empty | Apply parameter values after the normal model update |

Each `ParameterInput` specifies an existing model parameter ID, a finite value, a blend mode (`Override` or `Add`), and a weight in `[0, 1]`. IDs must be unique. Results are clamped to the model's declared range. These overrides can drive mouth parameters, but audio analysis and lip-sync input are application responsibilities.

## Handle events and errors

| Event | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `Ready` | The mounted instance published its first frame and accepts commands |
| `MotionFinished` | Reports the playback ID and `Completed`, `Interrupted`, or `Stopped` |
| `HitAreaTapped` | Reports a model-defined hit-area name |
| `PlaybackFailed` | Reports an operational error after mounting |

Load failures include a code, package path, diagnostic message, and an optional original `IoError`. Command failures are returned directly: an unattached controller returns `NotAttached`, and an instance preparing its first frame returns `NotReady`. Synchronous command rejection does not also emit `PlaybackFailed`.

Invalid configuration, such as duplicate parameter IDs, an out-of-range playback rate, or sharing a controller between mounted views, throws an exception. Canceling loading follows HuxerUI task cancellation rather than returning a normal load error.

A failed backend can be retried by remounting the model. Automatic device-loss recovery is not implemented. First-time graphics preparation may take time, especially on Android; show loading feedback until `Ready`.
